Hi 👋 My name is Alex Rodriguez
===============================

Cybersecurity
-------------

Hello! My name is Alex and I am a current cybersecurity student in 
school studying. I enjoy how expansive this field is and the methodology
 behind it. With Cybersecurity it’s not if, it’s when. There are a lot 
of companies that have gone through a lot of hardships and they turn to 
cybersecurity professionals who can assist them in reducing their risk 
in a effective and collaborative manner. Building a plan and strategy 
based on what the landscape is and what their strategy is with the right
 skillset. I enjoy a more pro-active approach of tracking cyber 
criminals and APTs. Coming up with innovative and creative ways to track
 hackers and what they’re targeting before they even get a chance. Then 
to use that knowledge to help and secure companies.
